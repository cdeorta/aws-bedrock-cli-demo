# 🚀 AWS Bedrock CLI Demo

A hands-on project for learning how to build generative AI applications using **Amazon Bedrock**.

📚 Developed as part of the **CSU AI Summer Camp** hosted by **Amazon AWS**  
🎓 Participant: **Carlos De Orta** | CSULB Computer Science Student

## 🧠 About This Project

This repository contains CLI-based exercises and demos built while attending the  
**Building Generative AI Applications Using Amazon Bedrock** course on AWS Skill Builder.

The goal is to explore how to use **Amazon Bedrock** with services like **LangChain** to build secure, scalable, and intelligent AI-powered applications.

## 📦 Modules Covered

This project aligns with the following course modules:

1. **Introduction to Amazon Bedrock**
2. **Foundation Models**
3. **Application Components**
4. **Using LangChain**
5. **Using Knowledge Bases**
6. **Using Agents**

Each module explores real-world topics such as:

- Model inference with foundation models
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LangChain chains, retrievers, and agents
- Knowledge base integration
- Prompt templates and embeddings
- Responsible AI and Guardrails
